You can often identify a proxy column. Which of the following three characteristics might help you identify a proxy column:
1.	The name of the proxy column is similar to the target column
2.	The proxy column has significant correlation (Pearson's R) with the outcome column
3.	The proxy column was derived after the outcome was noted

Answers:
Statements 1 and 2
Statements 1 and 3
Statements 2 and 3
Statements 1, 2, and 3
none of the statements
-----------------
The following statements creat a vector z.  Which of these vectors is not a constant column

Answers:
z <- c(7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7)
z <- 1:23
z <- rep(NA, 4)
z <- c("a", "a", "a", "a", "a")

A Proxy Column is an example of:

Answers:
Target Leakage
A Constant Column
Bad Predictor
A Key Column
-----------------
A Proxy Column will affect a classification or estimation in this manner:

Answers:
Accuracy will probably increase
Accuracy will probably decrease
No effect
Accuracy will be significantly below 0.5
-----------------
A Constant Column will affect a classification or estimation in this manner:

Answers:
Accuracy will probably increase
Accuracy will probably decrease
No effect
Accuracy will be significantly below 0.5
-----------------
A Key Column (ID Column) will affect a classification or estimation in this manner:

Answers:
Accuracy will probably increase
Accuracy will probably decrease
No effect
The target outcome will have the values of the Key column

What should you think of when the model predicts the training data and test data outcomes perfectly:

Answers:
Overfitting
Proxy Column
Fortuitous Patterns in a Key Column
A Constant Column
-----------------
What should you think of when the model predicts the training data outcomes very well but not the test data outcomes:

Answers:
Overfitting
Proxy Column
Fortuitous Patterns in a Key Column
A Constant Column
-----------------
When applying a model to Training Data and to Test Data, the following is common:

Answers:
The model predicts better on the training data than on the test data
The model predicts better on the test data than on the training data
The model is just as accurate on the the training data as it is on the test data
Model accuracy cannot be assessed on either training or test data
